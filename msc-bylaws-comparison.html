    <p>MSC Bylaw Comparison – <span class="bg-info">October 2014 version</span> and <span class="bg-success">Proposed version</span></p>
    <p><em>by Chris Smith</em></p>
    <p>Bylaws describe the internal connections and governance processes of an organization. MSC has bylaws that were forced on us by others in the 1990s that describe a totally defective structure incapable of connecting with, or being controlled by its members. Proposed Bylaws describing the optimum structure for our sport have existed for years but never passed by the MSC Board or members. Three of the articles of these two versions provide details of very different structures for our organizations, how it connects with and is governed by its members. Other articles have few significant differences which would affect the operations and connections to membership. We look at the most relevant articles and their differences;</p>
    <p>The Objectives of the Corporation were included in the bylaws until 2014, then removed but still available on the MSC website. Neither states that SNC shall have any control of MSC’s operations, both state that MSC and SNC shall have a cooperative relationship on rules. </p>
    <p>The differences in Definitions (Article 1.2) in the two bylaws are very important as they define very different organizations.</p>
    <p class="bg-info">The October 2014 Definitions are very brief and omit some key components, leave roles and relationships undefined and unclear. This is a key factor in the lack of internal connections within MSC and the inability of members to have any meaningful involvement in the governance of our sport.</p>
    <p class="bg-success">The Definitions in the Proposed bylaws are comprehensive and describe in detail all components, the registered swimmers and their clubs and how they connect with and control their national organization through a provincial structure which could be one like MSABC, MSM or MSO, or a body or conference established by the registered swimmers and clubs in a province to provide that connection between the members and MSC. These structures and relationships provide the strong, member controlled connections appropriate for a sport like ours and involves our members directly in its governance.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Article 1.10 in both states that MSC shall affiliate with AFC and FINA, there is no mention of affiliation with SNC or its PSOs. This follows the 1992 directives of the Canadian Government and FINA.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Article II defines Members, in 2.2, </p>
    <p class="bg-info">Voting Members are PMOs, or PSOs, and clubs. This is very confusing as although the clubs far outnumber the PMOs or PSOs, it seems that some PSOs demanded special privileges with regards meetings. The current MSC bylaws describe an organization with almost no connection with its members, between its members, and no control of its operation by its members. </p>
    <p class="bg-success">Voting members are the delegates elected by the members of the PMOs on a proportional basis and are the primary governing body of MSC, directly involved in the development of programs and policies, approving the actions of the Board and committees, electing the Board and officers, at their annual convention. This describes a highly-connected national body fully controlled by its members at all levels. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>Article III defines the Meetings of Members.</p>
    <p class="bg-info">The current bylaws provide no opportunities for connections between MSC and its component parts or ability of members to have any real authority over our sport. This is the primary reason that others, over several decades, could take control of our organizations at all levels for their own financial benefits.</p>
    <p class="bg-success">The proposed bylaws require a comprehensive conference of provincial delegates where they can get to discuss the issues, policies and programs and make informed decisions on them, get to know the Board candidates, each other and their concerns from across Canada and resolve them. They also create strong two-way connections and communications between MSC and all its members through this structure. Although only 2 to 3% of the members would be involved at the national or provincial level, their involvement would lead to a far more informed membership base at the club and provincial levels. All meetings would be open to members. </p>
    <hr>
    <p>The remaining articles of the bylaws do have some variations related to the differences outlined in the first three articles, however, the articles above are the important ones for members to understand.</p>
