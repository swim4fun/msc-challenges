    <h1>Masters Swimming in Canada - Challenges and Solutions</h1>
    <p><em>by Chris Smith</em></p>
    <p>Masters Swimmers in Canada have for many years faced major disruptions of their operations and sport and what many members feel is inappropriate control of these by others. The organizations creating these challenges for Canadian masters are Swim Canada, SNC, and their Provincial bodies, PSOs.</p>
    <p>SNC and their PSOs claim that they have been given full authority to control Masters in Canada by FINA, also by our Canadian FINA Member, AFC, and by the Government of Canada and the Provinces and consequently Canadian masters have no authority to have any control of their sport or how it is operated. Some of those who have been involved in swimming, both masters and high performance, over this period know this is false information regarding this authority and its origins. This authority to control us did not originate from FINA, AFC or the government and certainly not from masters. It is purely self-asserted and therefore has no real legitimacy.</p>
    <p>The focus and operations of masters swimming is totally different from that of high performance swimming. Also, masters are fully capable of operating it themselves and they, and adult health in Canada, would benefit greatly if they had full control of their sport. There is no logic to these two sports having anything but a cooperative relationship between them. </p>
    <p>Masters swimming was introduced into Canada from the US in 1971. Masters here wanted to set up a similar organization to USMS here where its members would control its clubs and provincial bodies, also elect the provincial delegates to the MSC national convention where they would be the primary governing body of our sport. These delegates would be involved in developing programs, approving actions of the Board and committees and elect the Board and officers. This structure would strongly connect masters to MSC, which they would fully control. It would also strongly connect members from across Canada, allowing them to get to know each other, work together to solve problems, develop programs beneficial to their members and to adult health in Canada. They wanted the optimum structure, including internal and external relationships for a national masters swimming organization, like USMS.</p>
    <p>Canadian masters worked in the 1970s and 1980s to establish such a structure. In Ontario for example, MSO ran all their operations and programs by 1985 and they and Swim Ontario, SO, agreed that MSO should operate independently and that there was no need for SO to be involved. MSO was incorporated, with a structure like the USMS State bodies in 1988. Several other provinces, and MSC, were moving in the same direction, some incorporated shortly after MSO. </p>
    <p>By the mid 1970s several PSOs had realized that if they assisted the masters in their provinces, who were not yet incorporated, by providing registration or insurance, for example, they could charge the masters for these services and also add the masters’ membership numbers to their provincial grant applications, thereby increasing their grants and providing themselves additional funds to spend on themselves.</p>
    <p>SNC and the PSOs also found they could obtain corporate sponsorship on behalf of “their masters”, funds which again they could spend on themselves, not on masters or masters’ programs.</p>
    <p>These are the foundational causes of Canadian masters’ challenges over the last four decades and the current impending collapse of our governing bodies and sport today.</p>
    <p>By 1980 several PSOs were demanding that SNC take full control of masters and not allow them to develop a connected, member controlled structure like USMS, for these reasons. This was resisted by many in both some PSOs and SNC who believed that SNC had no interest in masters, that masters were fully capable of governing themselves, that such action was unethical and could do great harm to their sport if the public found out.</p>
    <p>By 1988 SNC, due we were told, to intense pressure from some PSOs, had decided that they would take full control of Canadian masters’ organizations for their own financial benefit. This coincided with a decision by the FINA Bureau that year to take over and destroy Masters Swimming International, MSI at the World Masters Championship in Indianapolis in 1992. This was again because FINA realized they would achieve significant financial benefits from controlling Masters at the World level. The 1994 MSI Worlds were scheduled to be held in Montreal, hosted by the Quebec masters’ association, MSC and MSI. For this reason, we were told, FINA informed SNC of their secret plan in late 1988. This may have been a key factor in SNC’s decision.</p>
    <p>There were challenges in SNC achieving this. They spoke to the Government, to Industry Canada, and were told that the government would require that SNC and MSC have a cooperative relationship only, one could not control the other. We were told that this policy was in part based on the study carried out by the US Congress in the 1970s of the AAU and their passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. The Congress had found that having one sports body control another was highly detrimental to the sports involved. This included exploitation, discrimination against certain groups (adults?), inefficiencies and corruption. This investigation and Act had a very positive influence on aquatics in the US, specifically on the very cooperative, positive and productive relationship between USMS and USA Swimming, and on the operations and services provided by both to their members and communities.</p>
    <p>Prior to speaking to MSC in May, 1989, SNC developed strategies to maintain their full control of masters for their financial benefits over the long term. They knew that FINA, once they took control of World masters in 1992 would declare that “Masters” was now a recognized FINA sport and that consequently its members, Aquatics Canada, AFC, in our case, must recognize and include them in their organization, as a “member” of AFC. SNC realized that they must make sure that MSC was not incorporated in August, 1992 so that they could claim MSC could not be a member of AFC, requiring instead that they affiliate with AFC through SNC.</p>
    <p>SNC realized that they must ensure that MSC incorporate with a highly-disconnected structure, eliminating MSC members’ ability to connect with it and each other, control MSC and their PMOs, and therefore understand the causes of their challenges, and correct them. They realized that they must prevent them from having adequate funding for a convention. This would allow SNC to misinform MSC members about the causes of their difficulties, to isolate the larger PMOs with the stronger masters’ organizations and turn PMOs against each other. They informed MSC at this meeting in May 1989, that they were taking control of MSC’s incorporating process “in order to assist them with it.” In fact, we now know it was to delay it until after August, 1992 and control the MSC structure. MSC was incorporated in 1993 with a totally disconnected structure. </p>
    <p>SNC understood that their control of MSC would not be supported by FINA or the Government of Canada. They therefore needed other strategies to offset this. Masters in the 1980s had understood that once they incorporated they would be self funded and administered and would cease to pay SNC and the PSOs fees, which prior to incorporation dealt with registration and insurance. SNC and the PSOs, on the other hand, realized that they must retain these fees so that they could include masters’ membership numbers in their government grant applications.</p>
    <p>They also felt that their claim of controlling “sanctioning” of masters’ competitions would be an excellent destabilizing weapon to continue this control and exploitation of masters, even though these is no logical reason for them to be involved in the masters sanctioning process.</p>
    <p>At the May, 1989 meeting, SNC informed MSC that they were taking control of their incorporation, that the fees to SNC would continue after incorporation, as would the SNC control of masters sanctioning. The MSC members were understandably very angry and said so. SNC “fired” the MSC Board, still officially a committee, and said they would replace them with provincial masters representatives whose primary responsibility would be to act in the “best interests of SNC” and their PSOs on all matters.</p>
    <p>This meeting was a turning point in MSC’s development and its relationship with SNC. Many of those who had been enthusiastically working to build the optimum masters organization in Canada refused to have further involvement in our governance. Many left the sport as they wanted no connection with SNC. Those who remained involved found that working in masters’ governance was highly frustrating and a hostile experience. Due to these and other actions by SNC and their PSOs, MSC membership declined and by 2000 MSC had effectively ceased to function. A few dedicated staff maintained a few programs. </p>
    <p>FINA took control of MSI at Indianapolis in 1992 to the shock and disgust of the masters attending that event. This was clearly a hostile takeover without any agreement from masters or their organizations. FINA then held a meeting there and explained that they would treat masters well and provide them with many new programs at the World level. Many masters there were very skeptical, as it turns out, correctly. FINA also stated that “Masters” was now a component of FINA, a member of the “FINA Family” of aquatic sports and FINA members, AFC in our case, must structure themselves accordingly. They, the FINA Members, must recognize that “Swimming” and “Masters” are two separate and very different sports and should both be included, equally, in their organization to link their sports to FINA. </p>
    <p>AFC is not a “governing” body. It is primarily a link between the national aquatic sports and FINA. In discussions with the other members of AFC, we were told that SNC, by far the strongest member of AFC, had in 1992, and since, insisted that they control the “Masters” issue at AFC, and that MSC must not affiliate directly with AFC, as FINA and the Government insisted, but through SNC. This linkage through SNC has been highly detrimental to MSC over the years, not only as it contributed to SNC’s control and exploitation of Canadian masters, it also disconnected MSC from FINA. </p>
    <p>It was clear that the pressure to control masters did not come equally from the PSOs from across Canada. The six smaller provinces with approximately ten percent of the MSC membership had limited numbers and strength for both the PSO and PMO and do not appear to have played a major role in this, except they were sometimes used by SNC to further their objectives. MSABC and MSO with well over half the MSC membership had both evolved into relatively strong independent, member controlled organizations with relatively little interference from their PSOs. We have often been told that the two PSOs that insist on controlling the “Masters issue” at SNC were the two with the highest provincial grants. </p>
    <p>By 1990 officials in both BC and Ontario recognized that having the PSO staff deal with the education and provision of officials for all swim competitions was inefficient and detrimental to the sport. In 1995 the Ontario officials established the Ontario Swimming Officials Association, OSOA, to train and provide swimming officials for all Ontario meets. This was governed on a regional basis in Ontario and very soon developed, all by volunteers, the optimum programs for training, registering and providing officials. These programs were soon being used across Canada and in some other countries. Although these programs were developed by volunteers there were costs related to providing them to the users and in OSOA’s operations. The MSO members agreed to play a major role in funding OSOA, a far greater contribution than their usage of officials would require, but which they were happy to do. The training of current officials in Ontario are disproportionally funded by the competitive members of MSO. We were told a similar situation developed in BC.</p>
    <p>These relationships in Ontario where we had virtually independent masters and officials’ organizations working together and with Swim Ontario in a highly beneficial and cooperative relationship for the great benefit of all swimming in the province, were, we understand, of considerable concern to some other PSOs. They felt, probably due to pressure from their own officials and masters wanting a similar structure, concerned that this could threaten their total control of all aspects of these sports in their provinces. We were told that they exerted pressure on both the Ontario and BC PSOs to take control of both officials and masters organizations. The benefits to swimming appeared to be immaterial. Two years ago, Swim Ontario took control of and destroyed OSOA, officiating in Ontario has deteriorated significantly since. Last year Swim Ontario moved to take full control of masters and destroy MSO. Clearly the quality of swimming is not a concern to SNC and these PSOs, only their control for their own financial benefit matters. </p>
    <p>SNC knew in 1993 that their claim of authority over MSC was questionable and that it was essential that MSC agree that they were controlled by SNC and that SNC provided them with the path to FINA. Shortly after incorporation they asked MSC to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, confirming this. The MSC Board, after some consultation with the members, refused. SNC attempted to get MOUs signed with MSC several times after this, always without success, until recently. In May, 2016 the MSC Board signed a MOU with SNC confirming for the first time that they agreed that SNC has significant rights to control and exploit Canadian masters, and that masters effectively have no control of their sport. This action by the MSC Board was not supported by its members and clearly is not in their interest. </p>
    <p>During this period since 1993, SNC had convinced Sports Canada that they and their PSOs operated all masters’ operations, that masters was a “competitive swimming sport” like SNC, and it was therefore appropriate for SNC and the PSOs to add masters’ numbers to their grant applications. The governments at both the federal and provincial levels refuse to check this out and it seems are fully supportive of SNC’s control, exploitation and abuse of Canadian masters and their organizations, and their misappropriation of government grants. Many question their motivation for this.</p>
    <p>The federal and provincial governments must recognize their significant contribution to this control and exploitation of Canadian masters by SNC and the highly detrimental effect this has had on our sport and, perhaps more importantly, the denial of health benefits of our sport to many Canadian adults. </p>
    <p>Actions by the MSC membership to find out why MSC was so disconnected and dysfunctional, and fix it, in 2002, did lead to a new enthusiasm, significant membership growth and new programs, and a start to understanding the causes and solutions to our challenges. SNC and their PSOs quickly reacted, stepped in and had blocked this initiative by 2007. SNC recognized that their continued control and abuse of masters could lead to a revolt and bad publicity, so initiated what they called the “Charm Offensive” to counteract this. Since then there has been a deterioration of programs and membership growth. In the recent two years, we have seen further deterioration of programs, the web site, communications and transparency, also questionable MSC Board actions and elections. This unfortunately at a time when an activity such as masters would be highly beneficial to an increased aging Canadian population.</p>
    <p>We also note that by 2000 the members of SNC recognized that their structure was ineffective and undermining their sport, in part because of the disconnections within it. In 2004 they changed their bylaws making significant changes to improve their structure, providing much stronger connections between the members and SNC and between the members across Canada. Some MSC members naively believed in 2004 that SNC would support MSC doing the same thing. Instead SNC’s strong internal structure has allowed them to more easily work together since then to control and exploit Canadian masters.</p>
    <p>Recent actions by SNC, using their sanction weapon against us on several occasions, demanding all MSC members be registered as members with SNC, have added to this decline. The recent fracturing of the MSO membership particularly as it relates to registrations for those going to Quebec or Budapest clearly has but one objective, to destroy all control that MSO members have of their sport. Many masters again question the role of the MSC Board and staff in this, supporting it seems, SNC’s increased control and exploitation of Canadian masters. </p>
    <p>So, what can we do about this? Probably quite a lot, but it would take a major involvement of our members in demanding change. We must inform and mobilize our membership. We recognize that most members do not want to get involved in such actions. It would however only take about 3% of our members, scattered in our clubs across Canada, informing themselves on these issues and their solutions, connecting with others, and taking actions that would achieve success. </p>
    <p>There are several things we can do that would help make this change. Some suggest we press the MSC Board to give ninety days notice to SNC of their termination of the MOU, also possibly making some significant changes to the Board and staff of MSC at future MSC elections.</p>
    <p>They suggest we call for a full independent investigation by Sports Canada. Sports Canada should require that MSC become a full member of AFC and that MSC and SNC and their provincial bodies have purely cooperative relationships. This request has been made several times over the years without success, so our strategy in moving them on it must change if they do not act on it.</p>
    <p>We could start negotiations at the provincial and national level with SNC and the PSOs on developing a totally cooperative relationship with them. With the other actions we take they might realize that a quiet transfer of full authority of our sport into our hands might be the best way forward for all.</p>
    <p>If this does not work, and it has not so far, we could start talking to the opposition parties about these issues, which might wake up the government on this. We could also start talking to the media. We recognize that a full expose of SNC’s actions on this could detrimentally effect high performance swimming in Canada. But have SNC, their PSOs and governments left us any other choices?</p>
    <p>Perhaps we need to do all the above.</p>
    <p>These actions would all help, however, there is one fundamental cause of our problems which we will never eliminate unless it is corrected, and which we, the members of MSC, have total control of. That is the internal structure of MSC forced on us by SNC. MSC as defined in its current bylaws is a totally disconnected organization, it is undemocratic, lacks any possibility of member control by its members. It is effectively incapable of governing our sport. This is our foundational problem. It is an issue that we control. Bylaws describing the optimum, democratic, member controlled, strongly connected national body exist and if approved by the Board and members would allow us to start to build such a structure and provide optimum services to our members and the health of Canadian adults. Doing so would slowly eliminate over time our other challenges, including SNC’s control and abuse of our members and sport.</p>
    <p>We recognize that getting such bylaws approved would be challenging. This is primarily because our current disconnected structure provides little opportunity for our members to connect or communicate across Canada. The PSOs on the other hand have significant control of information going to the masters in their provinces. This could be overcome by those members in clubs across Canada informing themselves then informing other members on these issues. Social media today helps make that possible. Support of the government and media on this would also help significantly.</p>

    <p>There has been input to this document from several prior Board members of MSO, MSC, SO and SNC plus other aquatic organizations. </p>
    <p>I have been involved in competitive swimming in high school and university, again in masters since the 1980s. I have been a swimming official since the 1960s and heard much about masters and issues related to them from other officials in the 1970s but did not have time then to get involved. I was involved in the establishment and operation of other NFP organizations since the 1960s and am familiar with many highly successful ones, and some clearly less so, also the foundational causes for these differences. I have been on the Boards and Executives of MSO, MSC, OSOA and LatyCar, an international Masters organization. I have attended many Swim Ontario and SNC AGMs and other gatherings. I have attended eight USMS Conventions. I was in Indianapolis in 1992 for Worlds and attended several meetings related to the issues above. I have attended several FINA masters’ meetings and had numerous discussions with FINA Bureau members on these and other issues related to our sport. I have from these experiences much primary source data from discussions with many of those who have had a significant impact, positively or negatively, on our sport. Many of those involved have contributed to the above.</p>
    <p>I have extensive files on masters’ issues, minutes, correspondence, etc. going back to the 1970s many of which support the above matters. Many of these were given to me by those involved in MSC’s development in the 1970s to 1990s for safe keeping. </p>
    <p>The report by Prof. Donald Hastings and others of the Sociology Department at the University of Tennessee, April 6, 2002, on the evolution of modern sports organizations, specifically the differences between the evolutions of USMS and MSC, covers many of the issues above to that point in time.</p>
